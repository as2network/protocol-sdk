# @as2network/batch-utils

A utility to batch Ethereum transactions in a single transaction.

## Overview

-   better user experience if you need do send (or re-send) many transactions
-   save gas
-   execute a sequence of transactions as an atomic transaction - if one fails, all do

## Usage

Install the package `npm install @as2network/batch-utils`.

```javascript
const Web3 = require("web3");
const Batcher = require("@as2network/batch-utils");

// the address where the helper contrat is deployed
const batcherAddress = "<deployment_address>f";
const web3 = new Web3("http://localhost:8545/"); // or another ethereum provider

batcher = new Batcher({ web3, batcherAddress });

// create web3 transactions as you would normally
const tx1 = myContract.myMethod(myArg1, myarg2);

// call a function on a contract
const tx2 = {
    to: "0x11f4d0...e",
    data: "0x123454...",
};
// send some money to your friend
const tx3 = {
    to: "0x116DAe....",
    value: "1000000000000000",
};

// send the transactions as a single transaction to the blockchain
// the batched transaction will fail if one of the subtransactions fail
const receipt = await batcher.sendTransaction([tx1, tx2, tx3]);
console.log(receipt.events);
```

## API

```javascript
const batcher = new Batcher({
    web, // web3 instance, required
    batcherAdddress, // address of batcher contract, optional if the network is main or rinkeby
});
```

A `Batcher` instance exposes a fucntion `sendTransaction`. The signature and behavior of the function is similar to the [sendTransaction method in web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth.html#sendtransaction) - the function can be called by providing it with a callback,
if the callback is omitted it will return a Promise - but instead of taking a single transaction object as its first argument, it takes a list of transactions.

```javascript
batcher.sendTransaction(
    transactions, // a list of web3-style transaction objects
    callback // optional, like in web3.js
);
```

The `batcher.sendTransaction` call will try to execute the entire list of transactions in the order that they are given. If one of them fails, the batched transaction fails atomically - i.e.\ none of the transactions will be executed.

`sendTransaction` behaves like `web3.eth.sendTransaction` - if a callback is provided, it will be called, if no callback is provided, it will return a promise that resolves to a transaction receipt.

## The Contract

The [solidity code](./contracts/Batcher.sol) is here.

## Limitations

-   The batched transactions will be sent from the Batcher contract - which means that transactions that require `msg.sender` to be (say) the account with which the batched transaction is signed, will fail. However, the batcher _will_ work when for sending Ether in batch transactions.
-   The batcher contract can only cal functions on existing contracts - it does not create new contracts

## TODO

-   use assembly `call` to save gas
-   use assembly `create` to also allow for contract creation
-   forward tokens, so that one can batch-send tokens as well as Ether
